YAWIK
=====

YAWIK offers a Web based solution for managing job applications. Jobs ads can
be entered or pushed to the system. The system assigns application forms to job
ads. Applicants and recruiters can connect to YAWIK using social networks. 
Currently it is possible to integrate YAWIK into a corporate Web site by 
extending it with a module. It is intended to become a distributed system for 
connecting recruiters and applicants.
