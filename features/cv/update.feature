    In order to apply a job
    As a User
    I should be able to manage my resume


    Background:
        Given I have a user with the following:
            | Login                 | test@resume.com           |
            | Fullname              | Test Resume               |
            | Password              | test                      |
        And I am logged in as "test@resume.com" identified by "test"


    Scenario: Updating personal informations
        Given I go to manage my resume page
        Then I should see "Manage my resume"
        When I click edit on my personal information
        And I wait for 1 seconds
        And I fill in the following:
            | First name        | Test              |
            | Last name         | Resume            |

        And I select "Mr." from "Salutation"
        And I press "Save"
        And I wait for the ajax response
